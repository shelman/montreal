      <h1>Happy Birthday Mom and Dad!</h1>

        Happy 70th birthday Mom! Your present from us is a trip to Montreal in 2022. And Dad, since your 70th birthday present had to be refunded, this is your do-over present.

      <h2>Logistics</h2>

        <h3>Who</h3>

          The four of us! (Sam, Anna, Linda, Jim)

        <h3>When</h3>

          Either May or June of 2022, depending on everyone's schedules, for 4 nights (negotiable).

        <h3>What exactly is the present?</h3>

          We research, book, and pay for lodging, events, and food (everything other than flights). You don't have to deal with any logistics other than getting your plane tickets and letting us know if there's anything specific in Montreal you want to do.

      <h2>Lodging</h2>

        Our pick for lodging is the <a href="https://hotelnelligan.com/">Hotel Nelligan</a> in Old Montreal. It looks super charming and it's in a perfect location.
