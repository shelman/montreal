# Happy Birthday Mom and Dad!

Happy 70th birthday Mom! Your present from us is a trip to Montreal in 2022. And Dad, since your 70th birthday present had to be refunded, this is your do-over present.

## Logistics

### Who

The four of us!

### When

Either May or June of 2022, depending on everyone's schedules, for 4 nights (negotiable).

### What exactly is the present?

We research, book, and pay for lodging, events, and food (everything other than flights). You don't have to deal with any logistics other than getting your plane tickets, but of course let us know if there's anything specific in Montreal you want to do.

## Lodging

Our pick for lodging is the [Hotel Nelligan](https://hotelnelligan.com/) in Old Montreal. It looks super charming and it's in a perfect location.

## Potential Events and Activities

A small sampling of the things that we can do:

- [Museum of Fine Arts](https://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/)

- [Botanical Gardens](https://espacepourlavie.ca/en/botanical-garden)

- Food tours ([Jewish themed](https://wanderingchew.ca/) or [not](https://localfoodtours.com/montreal/))

- Exploring cool neighborhoods and areas: Mile End, Plateau Mont-Royal, the Underground City, McGill University, many more.

- A day trip to sugar shacks and orchards in the nearby Monteregie area.
