# Happy Birthday Mom and Dad!

Happy 70th birthday Mom! Your present from us is a trip to Montreal in 2022. And Dad, since your 70th birthday present had to be refunded, this is your do-over present.

## Logistics

### Who

The four of us!

### When

Either May or June of 2022, depending on everyone's schedules, for 4 nights (negotiable).

### What exactly is the present?

We research, book, and pay for lodging, events, and food (everything other than flights). You don't have to deal with any logistics other than getting your plane tickets, but of course let us know if there's anything specific in Montreal you want to do.

## Lodging

Our pick for lodging is the [Hotel Nelligan](https://hotelnelligan.com/) in Old Montreal.

## Potential Events and Activities

[Museum of Fine Arts](https://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/)
[Botanical Gardens](https://espacepourlavie.ca/en/botanical-garden)

## Food

The most important part! Some options include but are by no means limited to:

***Casual***
- [Schwartz's Deli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwartz%27s), famous spot for smoked meat.
- Bagels! Either [St-Viateur](https://www.stviateurbagel.com/), or [Fairmount](https://fairmountbagel.com/), or both.
